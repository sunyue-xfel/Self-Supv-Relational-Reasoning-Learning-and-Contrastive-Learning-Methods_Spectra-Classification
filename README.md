# Self-Supv-Relational-Reasoning-Learning-and-Contrastive-Learning-Methods_Spectra-Classification

In this project, we propose SpecRRMoco-Net, which is based on self-supervised relational reasoning and contrastive learning to 1D spectral classification problems.  The results show that SpecRRMoco-Net can effectively reduce the time spend by scientists annotating data manually, therefore offering great potential to automate the classification process.

Fig 1. Illustration of the proposed 1D spectra classification framework based on the self-supervised SpecRRMoco-Net, which is a combination of Relational Reasoning Network (SpecRR-Net) and Momentum Contrast Network (SpecMoco-Net). The classification framework consists of two parts, i.e., in the first stage, the encoder f_q is trained on unlabeled data to build useful representations, and in the second stage, a small number of labels are used to perform the downstream spectral classification task.
