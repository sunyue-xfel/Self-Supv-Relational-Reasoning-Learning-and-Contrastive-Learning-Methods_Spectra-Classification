# Self-Supv-Relational-Reasoning-Learning-and-Contrastive-Learning-Methods_Spectra-Classification

In this project, we propose SpecRRMoco-Net, which is based on self-supervised relational reasoning and contrastive learning to 1D spectral classification problems.  The results show that SpecRRMoco-Net can effectively reduce the time spend by scientists annotating data manually, therefore offering great potential to automate the classification process.
